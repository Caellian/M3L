--------

If you're unfamiliar with [gradle](https://gradle.org/), you can check out it's free and turough online [documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html).
Python script uses [SSJB](https://bitbucket.org/cuchaz/ssjb) by Cuchaz and it's tasks functionality to interact with command prompt/terminal. You can get a list of tasks by just running the program and you use tasks by adding them as arguments.
